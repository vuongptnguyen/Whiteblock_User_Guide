Overview
************

[Whiteblock](https://www.whiteblock.io) is a full-stack blockchain testing platform that helps development teams quickly test & deploy high-performing distributed ledger technologies. 

The Whiteblock platform users to provision multiple fully-functioning nodes (>1000) within a private test network over which they have complete control. Transactions, behaviors, and other logic can be automated as nodes interact in real-time, allowing testers to observe the performance of protocols, algorithms, decentralized applications, or changes to system infrastructure prior to deployment. 

Each node exists within its own Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) and is assigned a unique IP address. This provides logical separation between nodes. The links between these nodes can be configured with latency, packet loss, and other WAN conditions according to user specification in order to replicate real-world performance that is accurate within .01 milliseconds.

Use Cases
=========================

-	Blockchain agnostic.
-	Simulate live, global network with data & statistics in real-time.
-	Provision and configure multiple independent nodes.
-	Test fault tolerance.
-	Configure latency, packet loss, & bandwidth.
-	Randomize or configure transactions size, frequency, & rate.
-	Private, integrated development environment.

Features
=========================
  - Automate Genesis Ceremony - Quickly provision a functional blockchain network without the additional hassle of editing a configuration file every time a new test network is provisioned.
  - Account/Wallet Creation - Indicate total number of accounts/wallets to be created within network. 
  - Pre-allocate Funds - Fund these wallet/accounts with a specified amount of assets. Start testing right away without the need to wait for a mining rewards. 
  - Transactional Logic - Indicate the value and volume of transactions to automate activity. Observe transactions per second and the effects of various environmental conditions on TPS.
  - Network Behavior - Configure Wide Area Network (WAN) conditions between nodes, including latency, packet loss, and bandwidth constraints to replicate real-world performance within a safe and controlled environment. 
  - Data Visualization - The Whiteblock Explorer provides insight into TPS, uncle rate, and other relevant data points and performance metrics.
  - Reporting - Create concise reports to summarize your test cases. 
  - Pipeline Integration - Whiteblock seamlessly integrates with your CI/CD platform of choice to reduce devlopment overhead.
